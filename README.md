# Platform_Game
It's the game I am working on written in python. Still work in progress!

To launch the game don't click the menu.py because thats work in progress open the Platform_Game! 

In the future I will show you how to make game run better!

If it's saying that the pygame isn't installed type this in cmd: pip install pygame
if that doesn't work type this in cmd: py -3.7 -m pip install pygame

Note: This is my first real game so I am taking my time. And I started proggraming this year so please be understanding if it's taking time.

***How to play:***
- "w" is to jump
- "a" to go left
- "d" to go right
- "s" doesn't do anything
- How to build blocks:
	- First left click the left-upper corner point of where you'll put your block then
	- Right click the right-down corner and the block should appear!
	- Shall you do it otherwise wierd things will happen
	
***Planned features:***
- Better graphics(as good as I can do them!) date: Not known
- Bigger worlds(Now it's only a plane in resolution 1280x1024 it would bring more width) date: Next stable update hopefully
- Moving camera(So you can move through world) date: Next stable update hopefully
- Two player support(More the merrier!) date: After/next stable update
- Some power-ups(Like double jump and more...) date: After the next update
- New modes(Like Fun mode where you could catapult yourself with blocks) date: unkown
