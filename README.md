# Platform_Game
It's the game I am working on written in python. Still work in progress!

In the future I will show you how to make game run better!

If it's saying that the pygame isn't installed type this in cmd: pip install pygame
if that doesn't work type this in cmd: py -'version' -m pip install pygame

Note: This is my first real game so I am taking my time. And I started proggraming this year so please be understanding if it's taking time.

To change from save mode to building change "save" in Platform_Game.py: R.El, PG.i, StarL, L.EnemyGroup = LB.Load_level_1(screen, "save", P) to "custom"

***How to play:***
- "w" is to jump
- "a" to go left
- "d" to go right
- "s" doesn't do anything
- How to go two player:
	- Press any of directional arrows to join(Not working)
- Custom mode:
	- How to build blocks(Up to version 1.1):
		- First left click the left-upper corner point of where you'll put your block then
		- Right click the right-down corner and the block should appear!
		- Shall you do it otherwise wierd things will happen
	- How to build blocks(After version 1.1):
		- First left click in one corner
		- Then right click to where the block spawn
	- How to spawn enemies:
