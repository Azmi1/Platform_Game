# Platform_Game
It's the game I am working on written in python. Still work in progress!

If it's saying that the pygame isn't installed type this in cmd: pip install pygame
if that doesn't work type this in cmd: py -3.7 -m pip install pygame

Note: This is my first real game so I am taking my time. And I started proggraming this year so please be understanding if it's taking time.

***Planned features:***
- Better graphics(as good as I can do them!) date: Not known
- Bigger worlds(Now it's only one plane 1280x1024) date: Next stable update hopefully
- Moving camera(So you can move through world) date: Next stable update hopefully
- Two player support(More the merrier!) date: After/next stable update
- Some power-ups(Like double jump and more...) date: After the next update

If you find any bugs email me: never.saymeme@gmail.com 

Thanks!
